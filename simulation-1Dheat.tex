\end{figure}

Our system is comprised of a rod fixed to a heated wall kept at constant temperature. The length of the rod is arbitrarily taken as 1m. The initial temperature of the rod is in equilibrium with the ambient temperature at 25$^{\circ} $C and the temperature of the wall is 200$^{\circ} $C.  We represent temperature at a point on the rod at some time with the function $u(x,t)$. Note that the rod is thin with respect to its length, thus is modeled as a 1D system, that is, temperature is solely a function of rod position and time. The goal of this simulation is to show the variations in temperature of various points on the rod over time. //

We take our initial state as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $T(0,t)=200 ^{\circ}$C
    \item $T(x,t)=25 ^{\circ}$C, $x\ne 0$
\end{itemize}

\noindent The partial differential equation of the 1D heat propagation:
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
\end{equation}
\noindent We explicitly state that $u(\dot)$ is a function of $x$ and $t$
\begin{equation}
 \frac{\partial} {\partial t}u(x,t) = \alpha \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}u(x,t)
\end{equation}
\noindent We use a finite difference approximation to get compute the derivatives in space and time
\begin{equation}
\frac{u_{i}^{N+1}-u_{i}^{N}}{\Delta t} =\alpha\frac{u_{i+1}^{N}-2u_{i}^{N}+u_{i-1}^{N}}{\Delta x^2}
\end{equation}

\noindent Rearranging we reach the final form we need for our Forward Euler approximation. Note that the quantity $\alpha\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}$ is Fourier's number, with $\alpha$ being the thermal diffusivity of a material. In the following simulations, we arbitrarily choose Aluminium with $\alpha = 9.7e-5$.

\begin{equation}
u_{i}^{N+1}=u_{i}^{N}+\alpha\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x^2}\big[ {u_{i+1}^{N}-2u_{i}^{N}+u_{i-1}^{N}}\big]
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Implementation}
We provide an implementation in Matlab.

     end
     u_cur(1) = wall_temp; % Set the left boundary to be our high of 200 
     u_old(:) = u_cur; % We move to the next time step, reset N-1 state
     u_plot = [u_plot; u_cur];

 \paragraph{Results}
\noindent We can create plots of the rods temperature as a function of time and position. This gives us insight into how the system evolves as we maintain our constant temperature.

\paragraph{Interpretation}
The results we obtain are consistent with our model and the physical characteristics. We can see that from the visualization the temperature falls off as $\frac{1}{x^2}$, which is 
consitent with the theoretical definition of the Fourier number as described above. We can see pathlines of the heat front evolve quadratically over time, especially when looking 
at the system from above. 

 \paragraph{Conclusion}
Here we have learned that in examining systems such as the heated rod, we can safely analyze it as a 1D system. We were able to discretize the partial differential equations and 
apply a forward Euler simluation to yield phyiscally relevant and meaningful simulations. Through the Matlab visualization, we gain a better understanding of how heat is moving 
through the rod and the system. From the resources and analysis provided, it is trivial to create other iinitial/boundary conditions and repeat the simulations to garner a deeper
insight into the heat behaviour. This is left as an exercise to the reader.
